Abstract
========

The First-Look Analysis and Feedback Functionality (FAFF) working group, identified the need for a service that is capable of executing user-defined operations/computation following user-defined rules. This service has been referred  to as Catcher. In essence, the Catcher is not that different from the Watcher or other event handling off-the-shelf technologies like Kapacitor. This technote explores the idea of using influx2.0 event processing capabilities to as an alternative implementation for the Catcher.
